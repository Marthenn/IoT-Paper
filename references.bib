abstract = {This comprehensive review synthesizes findings from 52 research papers on mobile rescue robots, emphasizing their pivotal roles in disaster management. Mobile rescue robots are designed to perform critical functions such as searching for survivors, extracting victims from hazardous environments, and evacuating individuals to safer areas. Their applications extend to disaster- specific tasks, including radiation mapping, hazardous material handling, and structural integrity assessments. The review delves into key technological advancements in navigation systems, highlighting innovations such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), multi-terrain mobility mechanisms, and autonomous path-planning algorithms. It examines breakthroughs in manipulation capabilities, including multi-degree-of-freedom robotic arms, adaptive grippers, and task-specific end-effectors, which enable precise handling of debris and delicate rescue operations. The integration of sophisticated sensors, such as thermal imaging, gas detection, and multi-modal environmental monitoring, has enhanced situational awareness, allowing robots to identify hazards and locate survivors effectively.},

ABSTRACT={<p>Actuator failure on a remotely deployed robot results in decreased efficiency or even renders it inoperable. Robustness to these failures will become critical as robots are required to be more independent and operate out of the range of repair. To address these challenges, we present two approaches based on modular robotic architecture to improve robustness to actuator failure of both fixed-configuration robots and modular reconfigurable robots. Our work uses modular reconfigurable robots capable of modifying their style of locomotion and changing their designed morphology through ejecting modules. This framework improved the distance travelled and decreased the effort to move through the environment of simulated and physical robots. When the deployed robot was allowed to change its locomotion style, it showed improved robustness to actuator failure when compared to a robot with a fixed controller. Furthermore, a robot capable of changing its locomotion and design morphology statistically outlasted both tests with a fixed morphology. Testing was carried out using a gazebo simulation and validated in multiple tests in the field. We show for the first time that ejecting modular failed components can improve the overall mission length.</p>}
